# Todo:

To create a multiplayer song guessing game, I will need to use a web development framework or language to build the front-end and back-end of the application. This will involve creating a user interface for players to interact with, as well as a server-side component to manage game state and communicate with the players' browsers.

- Here are the high-level steps I can follow to build this kind of game:

- Determine the game mechanics and rules. For example, I could have players take turns guessing the name of a song based on a short audio clip, with points awarded for correct guesses and deducted for incorrect ones.

- Design and implement the user interface for the game. This will likely include a way for players to enter their guesses, a display for the current game state (e.g. scores, current song, etc.), and possibly some additional features like chat or leaderboards.

- Develop the server-side component of the game, using a web development framework or language of your choice. This will involve creating an API or set of endpoints that the client-side code can use to communicate with the server and update game state.

- Implement the game logic on the server, including managing players, tracking scores, and determining when a round is over and a new one should begin. You will also need to integrate audio playback into the game, using a library or service that can stream or serve audio files to the players' browsers.

- Test and debug the game, and make any necessary improvements or changes based on feedback from players. You may also want to consider adding additional features or polish to the game, such as support for multiple rooms or game modes.
